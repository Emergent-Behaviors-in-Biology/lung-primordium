This repository holds analysis and plotting scripts used in Ikonomou et al., ["The in vivo genetic program of murine primordial lung epithelial progenitors"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14348-3).

To generate visualizations and explore data, open the Jupyter notebook `The Genetic Program of Lung Progenitors -- Linear Algebra Projections.ipynb` in the `Scripts` folder. This notebook contains code to regenerate all the projections, using the functions defined in `lap_v2_py3.py`. 

The basis of reference cell types was constructed by running `make_basis.py`, which assembles the data downloaded from public repositories and the newly generated _in vivo_ data stored in the `Source_Data` folder (see the manuscript for full bibliographic references on data sourcing). This folder also contains the results of the directed differentiation experiments, which is pre-processed along with the basis data when `make_basis.py` is run. The results of this processing are stored in files called `NewBasis.dat` and `master_table.dat` in the folder `Processed_Data`. 

The projections generated by the notebook are automatically exported to an Excel file, also stored in the `Processed_Data` folder.
